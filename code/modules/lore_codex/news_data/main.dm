	data = "Today's meeting of the Vir Bicameral led to the passing of the Wynther-Helsey Bill, an implementation of the legal framework \
	used in Aetolus to handle the production and cultivation of the Macrolimbus species dubbed \"Prometheans\". These ill-researched organisms \
	possess cognitive abilities easily equaling those of A-class drones, but so far have not been included under the EIO's list of dangerous \
	intelligences and are thus much more profitable for manufacture as expert systems by corporations such as NanoTrasen.\
	<br></br>\
	While many systems in the Almach Rim have already passed similar bills, this is the first system so close to Sol to have done so. More\
	concerning still is NanoTrasen's business practice regarding the intelligences: much like their positronic lines, sources within the\
	company indicate that they will be \"farmed out\" to employees of the corporation and residents of their Northern Star and Cynosure\
	habitation complexes. Quote our source, who wishes to remain anonymous, \"\[we\] call the program 'Lend-Lease', sometimes. The whole idea\
	is that we only have to pay the\ cost of the Promethean core, which is about 2000-3000 thalers after startup costs, and we still get\
	the data we need while \[our\] own employees pay to feed 'em and put hours into raising them.\"\
	<br></br>\
	The bill passed fairly quietly this afternoon, owing to the closed nature of the Bicamarial. A post-facto Occulum poll of voting-age\
	VGA citizens suggest that fully 80% of them did not even know what a Promethean was prior to the most recent general election. A\
	follow-up poll indicates that an appreciable number of Sivians do not support the framework's current implementation."

	reasons of security has chosen to remain annonymous. All outbound shipments affiliated with Nanotrasen have ceased.\
	<br><br>\
	While neither Grayson Manufacturies nor Nanotrasen have made an official statement, Nanotrasen CEO Albary Moravec has called the \

Quote Dr. Harper: \"Our previous silence was a necessity, while we consolidated our forces and dealt with corporatists both internally and in Vounna's former Grayson outposts.\". In Harper's hour-long address, she berates the failure of SolGov to provide adequate protections for Prometheans. \"We will not let the Promethean be another positronic brain; they will not labor under a century of slavery, deprived of a state to call their own. The Luddites of the Friends and of the Icarus Front will not be permitted to decide the fate of a nascent race before it begins.\"\
	<br><br>\
	Harper proceeded to unilaterally declare Vounna's independence from SolGov, claiming sovereignty over the system as the first Chairperson of the \"Aetolian Council\". Speaker of the Shadow Coalition ISA-5 has urged their government to treat the developing situation with caution but decried Harper's rhetoric, stating in a press release, \"While I know well the injustices visited on myself and my people by misguided forbearers, it is important to treat any emerging technology with respect. Current policies regarding the Prometheans are designed to limit risk during sociological trials on Aetolus and beyond. As for myself, I doubt the sincerity of this human who claims to speak for the Prometheans, when the Prometheans are perfectly equipped to speak for themselves.\"\

Icarus Front Chairperson Mackenzie West was quick to make a damning official statement: \"Dr. Harper and her radical agitators cannot be excused for their violent, despicable attempts to destabilize the flourishing economy of the Almach Rim.

	The decision faced resistance from more laissez faire Assembly member states, including prominent SEO governor Bruno Ofako, delaying an earlier consensus. Supporters of the action hope that this decisive display of military strength will encourage the rebels to stand down without further bloodshed, and submit to prosecution by the Lunar High Courts.\

	data = "Shocking the nation, in the wee hours UTC a number of governments in the Almach Rim announced their intent to secede from the Confederacy as a unified political organization they refer to as the Almach Association, joining the already-declared Aetolian Council. Among the half-dozen affected systems is Angessa's Pearl, through which the Song Shi was passing en route to Aetolus. The Association has already issued a political manifesto and a foundational charter, leading political scientists across the galaxy to suspect back-doors collusion and possible Shelfican interference, a hypothesis made more likely by Morpheus Cyberkinetics' exonet site voicing support for the Association. Others suspect a moment of political crystallization, not unlike that in the Golden Hour three centuries ago. These researchers are already referring to this morning's events as the Gray Hour.\
	<br><br>\
	The Association's official manifesto repudiates the Five Points, calling them \"an archaic and distinctly human invention\". Experts agree that this bold declaration puts the Movement more in line with the Golden Hour than with the Age of Secession, and many fear that nothing short of a miracle like the discovery of the positronics will spare humanity from a bloody civil war.\
	<br><br>\
	While the Association currently lists only a handful of Almach Rim systems as \"Constituent Organizations\", it has named Shelf, the Free Relan Federation, and the Eutopian Foreign Relations Board as \"observers\". The implications of this status are yet to be identified.\

	<br><br>\
	\
	\"Our decision to join the Association may, at first, seem strange. It is true that we have much to gain from trade with the Solars, and that the radical transhumanism of Angessa's Pearl is not our way. But I will remind you that it was Shelf, not Sol, who ensured our prosperity just over two decades ago-- who safeguarded our independence and prevented us from falling to barbarism and dictatorship. We owe it, not just to Shelf but to all the members of the Almach Rim, to support their independence just the same. And that, my fellow Relanians, is the crux of it all. The Association is a revolution, at the heart of it all, and many of the now-independent states were owned near-outright by Trans-Stellar Corporations until the Association allowed them to shake out their fetters. What right do we have to sit by while just a dozen light-years coreward newly-born republics suffer the growing pains of independence? What right do we have to bask in our own stability when our neighbors, our comrades in ideology, are struggling with a cruel blockade proposed by politicians back on Earth and Luna? That is why we must join with them, guard them, and guide them, for as long as need be.\"\

Captain Volkov of the SCG-D Henri Capet reports that the blockade-runners were highly organized and determined, citing several lightly-manned ships left behind to tie up the SolGov forces long enoughfor the freighters to escape, detonating their reactors when they lost the ability to continue fighting. This resulted in three Fleet casualties and a significant degree of damage to the Henri Capet. The contents and location of the freighters are unknown at this time. In response, eight light-response vessels are being assigned to the Saint Columbia Fleet Base from Jahan's Post and Zhu Que. Residents and traffic officials in Vir, Oasis, and Gavel are to remain alert and notify police if any suspicious or unregistered craft enter their space.\

A small group of operatives claiming to be associated with Mercurial terrorist organization Boiling Point invaded major refueling platform NLS Aquarius in the Republic of Gavel after hijacking civilian transport vessel WTV Orion and faking a drive failure. Several detonations were reported within the Aquarius, the operatives entering through unknown (potentially Skrellian) means. After stating their affiliation and desire for the liberation of all \"Prometheans, drones, and ex-humans\", they opened fire on a crowd of unarmed bystanders, killing as many as seven. A multiple-hour long firefight with Nanotrasen corporate asset protection ensued, at which point the operatives demonstrated capabilities well in excess of Five Points-prescribed limits. Asset Protection was successful in repelling the terrorists, though their harsh methods drew outrage from the people they were protecting, leading a notable director of research to resign her position with the corporation. Several operatives are still at large, though the SG-PV Juno recovered two living terrorists and one totaled synthetic platform. \
	<br><br>\
	The intervention of a local Defense Force drone wing on behalf of the terrorists leads many in the intelligence community to assume that more Boiling Point operatives remain active within Gavel, and possibly nearby systems such as Vir and Oasis. Some have also noted that elements of the terrorists' tactics and augmentations suggest Association training, though the specifics remain classified. More information as the story breaks."

At the end of nearly a week of closed-doors negotiations, the Association has agreed to send in a significant contingent of Association Militia vessels as a show of good-will. These vessels will be active in the Golden Crescent, searching for Boiling Point facilities believed to be located in the outskirts of major systems. The influx of manpower allows the Fleet to continue patrolling the Heights and the Bowl, in hopes of containing the spread of the organization. This operation also marks the opening of the Almach Cordon, although travelers are advised that migration between the regions will remain extremely limited.\
	<br><br>\
	While undoubtedly a sign of increased trust between the Confederacy and the Rim, some have voiced concerns with the action's adding legitimacy to the Association government. Quote Rewi Kerahoma, SEO Chairperson of the Board: \"The meeting with the Association regime was inappropriate, but actively allying with them is something else entirely. If the generals think we don't have the fleet to hunt down a bunch of rabble-rousers without weakening ourselves to piracy and foreign invasion, then it is a sign that we need to grow our shipyards in the Bowl, and give jobs to the hardworking Solars that live there-- not that we need to collaborate with terrorists.\"\
	<br><br>\
	Transgressive Technologies and Interior Police Executive Sifat Unar issued a memo indicating that, while the assistance of the Association's more conservative elements in this matter is appreciated, the Five Points of Human Sanctity remain intact and SolGov categorically refuses aid from \"transhumans, posthumans, uplifts, and Fortunates.\""

The Allens, staunch supporters of the Association and advocates for the criminal ark's inclusion in the organization, had attempted to seize control of the ship's agricultural region during the Almach Cordon. They effectively held the ship for a matter of weeks, but were defeated by loyalists to the reigning Crow family. Stripped of their position as rulers of the Third Stacks, their matriarch was summarily executed by spacing in what the current regime is referring to as an \"expedited exile\". This is believed to mark the end of the question of Neon Light's membership in the Association, and the nominal SolGov protectorate is expected to remain neutral for the foreseeable future."

	data = "As military vessels from the Almach Association continue to enter the Golden Crescent as part of a SolGov initiative to combat the Boiling Point terrorists believed to be hiding in the region, political unrest in the upstream portions of the region continue to grow. Many in the Republic of Saint Columbia, a small upstream nation, have responded to increasing militarization of their local Fleet base by taking to the streets, blocking pedestrian traffic in the capital of Barrueco and shutting down entire industries by destroying or disabling infrastructure. Quote rioter Luisa Tassis, \"we've been sick of the Fleeties squatting in our system and breathing down our neck, and now there's going to be even more of them? No, screw that. If there's going to be a war between the Rim and the Core, I know what side I'd rather be on.\"\

Loved ones separated by the cordon have a chance to communicate once more, trade is posed to recommence, and light has been shed on the conditions of Shelf, Relan, and Angessa's Pearl. Amid this light is a patch of darkness. The fourth major polity of the Association, the Aetolian Council remains inscrutable, with no publicly-available information in the system available after their purge of corporate loyalists during the Gray Hour. What reports do exist are rumors within the Rim of Aetolian projects to create a new, hardier strain of Promethean, potentially one in flagrant violation of the Five Points of Human Sanctity. It is also known that Aetolus is a contributor to the personnel of the military vessels that even now are active in the Golden Crescent, although no so-called \"Aeto-Prometheans\" are believed to be active outside of the rim at this time.\
	<br><br>\
	Aetolus is the only garden world in the Almach Rim and among the most difficult to reach from the nearby system of Saint Columbia. Its seclusion and economic independence give it a great deal of weight in the Association, where Council representatives are among the most vehement in their opposition to SolGov- at odds with the Association's decision to reject Boiling Point's pan-Solar revolutionary praxis. It remains to be seen if Aetolus' hawkish ideals will fade over time, but because of the structure of the Association, there is no real chance of the junta being expelled from the government or removed from control of the Vounna system."

	data = "Lifepods confirmed to have originated from response ship lost during the Gray Hour were found last week in the Vir system, impacting the NLS Southern Cross at high velocity and severely injuring the only two survivors of the expedition. Unfortunately, because of the generally confused conditions of their re-emergence from months of cryosleep, the fate of the lost ship remains incompletely understood. The first pod to be discovered contained Lieutenant Eos Futura, telecommunications expert on the Song Shi, who alleged that elements of the Song Shi's crew, including herself, mutinied against commanding officer Captain Yi He in an attempt to prevent the bombing of civilians in the Angessian capital of Skylight. The surivor of the second pod, Private Demori Salvo, accused Futura's faction of conspiring with Association spies to destroy the ship as part of the Gray Hour revolt. Both agreed that the mutineers detonated the ship's Supermatter power core when it became clear they were to be defeated.\
	<br><br>\
	A third pod, promising a resolution to the stalemate, was shot down by the SCG-P Juno after being misidentified as a hostile missile. The gunner responsible, Sergeant Ricardo Esteban, was found guilty by a court marshal and dishonorably discharged. While other pods from the Song Shi may still be traveling through SolGov space, it is considered unlikely based on both Futura and Salvo's account of the number of pods launched before the Song Shi was destroyed. Both were detained by staff at the NLS Southern Cross, who managed to prevent a violent altercation from breaking out between the two armed and disturbed servicepersons. The Colonial High Court has stated that it intends to hear testimony from both parties after they complete a course of mental health evaluation, and after the conclusion of the present state of heightened security."

While the research in question was believed to be destroyed, there is reason to suspect that it instead made its way into the hands of current Association leaders. In addition to proving their willingness to violate the Five Points, this demonstrates that the Angessians harbored schemes of secession since at the very latest Feburary 2559.

In addition, an unknown number of advanced drone intelligences and corresponding military hardware were seized by the raid and turned over to the Fleet. The prisoners, a mix of native Gavelians, Solars from throughout the Crescent, and Angessians, are to be tried and sentenced by the Io Special Court. While unarguably a demonstration of Association willingness to cooperate with Solar officials, the raid's strange timing and the fact that the Militia chose to exclude the Fleet from the action has prompted many to question their motives. Commodore Claudine Chevotet, staff officer for Admiral of the Saint Columbia Fleet Kaleb McMullen, has formally stated that she is \"extremely suspicious of this so-called co-operation.\" She has demanded that the Militia vessels remain on the Solar side of the Cordon and submit to a full inspection by Fleet and EIO personnel.

The company says that they are working at full capacity to ensure that affected security systems are replaced and such an attack cannot be repeated.\
	<br><br>\
	The incident began with reports of Oculum provided exonet service outages in the city of New Reykjavik on Sif, which anonymous sources within the company reported to have been caused by efforts to contain a cyber attack on one of their security systems. The unnamed attacker proceeded to use sections of the company's local infrastructure to broadcast high volumes of encrypted data through one of Oculum's long-range telecommunications satellite, denying all other outbound signals.\
	<br><br>\
	The attacks have since been traced to a WT-AME model drone in the offices of the New Rekjavik-based Morcom Incorporated, which has been confirmed to have \"self-destructed\" all data in its memory at the conclusion of the attack. The chassis has reportedly been turned over to the Emergent Intelligence Oversight for further analysis and potential data recovery.\
	<br><br>\
	According to a spokesperson from the EIO, the drone was able to override and disable both the Morcom Inc oversight intelligences and the SCG's own oversight measures, but that no telltale damage has been caused to software involved in the encrypted broadcast that would indicate long-term emergent infection, and that there is no evidence that the intelligence responsible for the attack is still present in Oculum Broadcast systems. A firmware update has been released to correct oversight intelligence vulnerabilities exploited in the attack, and drone operators are urged to update immediately.\
	<br><br>\
	Moments before the hijacked Oculum satellite was disabled by an apparent power overload, an unencrypted file appears to have been saved intentionally to the transmission logs. A second copy was found in the otherwise wiped chassis of the seized WT-AME drone. After thorough screening by cybersecurity experts within the company, what would seem to be a message from the emergent intelligence itself is available in full below.\

The most likely candidate for the nature of the Whythe Construction is some form of naval base or shipyard to supplement the extremely limited military hardware of the Almach Rim. Whythe is well-placed to survive the initial phases of a Solar invasion, and depending on the complex's complexity could tip the balance of power. Transtech and Interior Police Executive Sifat Unar indicated to reporters that Sol Central is aware of the situation and will be taking all possible steps to address it."

Hernandez, often viewed as as an extremist by officials within her own party, stated that while the Five Points are \"an essential part of Solar culture as a whole\" and stopped short of advocating their amendment, insistence that other nations adhere to the Five Points was an increasingly outdated policy that threatened to fragment \"a united humano-positronic front against Hegemony advances.\" According to Hernandez, \"a level of understanding has long since existed between Sol and Skrellian polities regarding non-intervention in Skrellian social science and self-modification. I merely suggest codifying this and extending the same courtesy to other potential allies against imperial expansion.\"\

The Icarus Front leader was at the forefront of a resolution to allow the secessionist government to remain independent of the Solar Confederate Government under the strict condition of faithfulness to Five Points laws, passing by a wide margin. Fundamental disagreement over Five Points regulation has been at the forefront of debate with the Almach provisional government, and is cited as one of the primary reasons for the systems' illegal declaration of independence early this year.\

	The internationally broadcast speech began with the much anticipated announcement that the Boiling Point terrorist group had been effectively destroyed, with over seven hundred arrests made over the course of the weekend as a result of sensitive data captured during the special forces raid in Vir on the 24th, including numerous high ranking members of the organization. West went on to praise forces involved in the months-long counter-terror operation, before highlighting the \"legacy of \[human\] togetherness\" that allowed it to happen - in a spiel that commentators suggest \"betrays the true intention of the Valentine's Ultimatum: Reunification\".\
	<br><br>\
	Under guidelines placed into effect by West and their political allies, Almach would be required to \"\[cease\] illegal research and human modification, and destroy all materials related to existing research\" by the stated date, with compliance determined by Solar officials. In addition, the Almach Militia is to end its integration with SCG Fleet forces and withdraw its forces from SCG systems by midnight on Friday. Military relations between the Confederation and the Almach movement are to remain in a state of conditional ceasefire for the duration of the ultimatum, and current trade restrictions are to remain in place.\

	According to voting records, the measure passed nigh-unanimously, with Speaker ISA-5 and some SEO iconoclasts abstaining from the vote. ISA-5 states that, while they personally support the enforcement of the Five Points, they could not in good conscience vote in an action likely to result in an invasion of Shelf, which they regard as a sibling colony to their own Sophia.

	Thank you. Citizens of the Solar Confederation, allies, and beyond... It is a great honor, on behalf of the Colonial Assembly to announce that joint operations against Boiling Point across the galaxy have come to an end. In the fight against brazen Mercurial terrorism, the Solar Confederate Government and her allies have prevailed.\
	<br><br>\
	Over the past two days alone, I can report that over seven hundred arrests have been made, from the distant system of Nyx, to right here in Sol. I hold in my hand a list. \[West holds up a sheet of paper\] Leaders, organizers, brutes and bombers have been captured by brave, hardworking security forces throughout human space. The rest of these criminals have been scattered to the wind... But not lost! I can confidently assert that every last one will be brought to justice.\
	<br><br>\
	No more! Shall the people of this great nation have to fear the machinations of radicals! No more! Shall these twisted minds impose their perversion of humanity through violence! No more!\

	This Assembly... Nay, this nation expresses its thanks the noble members of our military who joined together to make this outcome possible. We thank the Fleet, of course for their tireless action hunting down these killers, and their heroic action over this past weekend. We thank the Vir Defense Force, without whom we could never have located the intelligence that led to these decisive victories... The Almach Militia, for their cooperation in the apprehension of these so-called \"revolutionaries\". \[West clears their throat\] And of course, we thank the local forces - the police and reserves who dealt firsthand with the chaos sewn by Boiling Point in their vicious crusade.\

	It is in times of relief - of unity, times like this moment - that every human heart can be filled with pride. \[West places their hand over their heart\] Since the dawn of civilization, mankind has strived above all else for peace, for the cooperation of all humanity. It is this very legacy of togetherness that has allowed us such close friendship with species further afield - the Skrell, the Tajara, and beyond. These past nine months, we have seen, each of us, with our own two eyes what mankind can achieve - together.\

	Others have criticized the speech's seemingly communist tone, with Arielsson expressing approval for the socialist Free Relan Federation and the anarchist Casini's Reach despite opposing their secessionist ideals. Still others claim that the speech offered 'nothing but empty feelings' and that it lacked specific, actionable resolutions on the growing secessionist movement in VirGov. Some have even framed the Address as a form of political maneuvering by the venerable politician, claiming that he voiced unpopular sentiments specifically to hamper the Shadow Coalition's re-election bid after well-publicized disagreements with SC party bosses.\

	data = "This is, as you know, my last term in office. After this, I mean to retire-- really retire, I have a cabin in the mountains waiting for me along with a thick stack of old Bowler novels. Because this is my last term, I have the chance to do something pretty rare for a politician. I get to speak my mind.\
	<br><br>\
	I hear talk from some people-- mostly young people, people who have lived their whole adult life with me in the capital-- I hear them talking about seccession. Now, let's make it clear; I'm not going to belittle you, the way some of my colleagues would. Complaining about the government, especially one as big and as old as the Confederacy, is our gods-given right. It's never going to be perfect, and it's not half of what it could be. I have nothing against talking about it, I have nothing against turning that talk into action and actually seceding, with just cause. I've worked closely with Representative Hannirsdottir for ten years now, and while we don't agree on the issue of secession it's certainly never stopped us from cooperating.\
	<br><br>\
	But, uh, as you can probably guess, they're not talking about the old kind of seccession. They're not thinking we'll stop paying Solar taxes and strike it out alone, the way some people did during the Age of Seccession. They want to join the Association. Now, if I were Secretary-General West, I might wax poetic about how the Association is a 'betrayal of our own humanity', or some... or some crock of shit like that, if you'll pardon my language. We're not all humans here. We're Tajaran and Unathi and Skrell and Positronics and even a few Teshari. And while that 'Valentines Ultimatum' might win West a lot of points with their lackies, and with the kind of maintenance-dome troglodyte who thinks the First Accord was a mistake, it's done more for the Association's recruitment than their entire propaganda budget. It's become expedient for leaders on both sides to treat this like a fight between the Core and the Rim, or between humans and positronics, or between tradition and progressivism, but it's not any of these. It's the oldest fight in the book. It's republicanism versus autocracy, and we're not the autocracy.\
	<br><br>\
	Angessa's Pearl is a theocratic autocracy led by Angessa Martei, who owns all property on the planet down to her people's bland white jumpsuits and the gray slop they eat. This isn't propaganda. This is objective fact, and something Martei is open about. Her seccession is a means for her to get more and more naked power over her slaves, and to grow more and more of them, until she's the immortal center of an industrial empire. The people of the Pearl didn't make the choice to join the Association. The people that are building her fleet and dying for her cause had no say in the matter. The injustice, the oppression here isn't that their rights to 'self-improvement' or 'self-expression' or 'freedom of thought' were trod on-- the injustice is that SolGov, that we allowed these abuses to persist for as long as they did. The injustice is that there are still so few laws in place to prevent things like this from happening in new colonies. The injustice is that, on seeing Martei's schemes actualized, we didn't take a cold, hard look at just how that was allowed to happen.\
	<br><br>\
	I love SolGov. It's because of this love that I'm so furious at what we have allowed to happen to our people. The state of the Bowl is disgraceful. Nobody who looks to us for protection, who pays us taxes and levies, who is a member of our community, should live in fear of raider attacks. What we did to the positronics, the history we let ourselves repeat out of fear and greed, can never be forgiven, can never be repaired until Vir burns dark in our sky. The pogroms-- yes, the pogroms-- against the Unathi, against refugees fleeing their own religious autocracy, are a disgrace to everything we stand for. But of all the nations in the galaxy, with perhaps the exception of Casini's Reach, we are the only one founded for the good of the ruled, rather than the rulers. We are the only real commonwealth in known space. And that's why we need to strive for better. We are a burning beacon of liberty in a galaxy where nigh eighty percent of the population has no voice in the government. Every ounce of power we cede to the party bosses, or the corporations, or tinpot dictators like Angessa Martei, is a dimming, a flickering of that torch. \
	<br><br>\
	And this brings us back to the Association, and to those who sympathize with it. I do, too. I spent my entire career on sapient rights lobbying, on supporting the anti-malfesance efforts of my colleagues. For a disaffected positronic, for any friend to the positronic people, for those who have had their lives taken by corporations-- the Association seems like a miracle. And maybe, for those Mercurials, the ideas it's founded upon shine even brighter than our democracy. But I look at the Association, really look, and I see Angessa Martei lying in the center, spinning a great big web. I see Naomi Harper, lying through her teeth better than Mackenzie West ever could. Two of the biggest population bases in the Association, the two nations that started the whole Gray Hour, are autocracies. Once again, the ferver of the revolution is subsumed by the oligarchs who want to stay in power. I doubt, to the poor laborer on the Pearl, the word 'Mecurialism' means much. I doubt that once the shock of the seccession wears off, that the young Promethean soldier will find themselves in a better place in Harper's junta than they will here in Vir.\ I doubt that in ten years' time the miners, pioneers, and traders who seized their means of production will find the Association Militia a kinder master than Xion, Nanotrasen, or Major Bill's. \
	<br><br>\
	This is far from a blanket condemnation of every government in the Association. President Fisher of the FRF-- I consider her a friend. When she gave her speech this March about strengthening and guiding the Almachi Revolution, I thought long and hard about whether we might do the same. I certainly commend the effort. But the structure of the Association was penned by the same autocrats that, to do her words justice, Fisher will have to overthrow. There's no High Court, no checks or balances. The Association is an alliance penned as though deliberately ignoring two thousand years of political science. By striving to counter-balance these autocrats, Fisher plays into their hands. She commits her own fleet, weakens her own defenses against enemies closer to home, in the service of Martei's ambitions. \
	<br><br>\
	I don't see this whole affair as a chance to spread the galactic anti-corporate revolution the way President Fisher does, of course. I make no secret of my stance on Trans-Stellars, but I also know that we're better off with Sol than without. The 'Silent Collapse' was two hundred years ago, but we still bear the scars from it. When the Scandinavian Union pulled out support for the Sivian colonization project, SolGov saved us. I do mean saved us, sure as if they'd fished us out of a life pod. There were no factories, no steel, no concrete on Sif until the Engineering Corps built Radiance and New Reykjavik. Corporations and regional governments cowered from the Karan pirates, until the Marines chased them out. Whether Sivian or Karan, you owe the roof over your head to the Sol Confederate Government. With that great debt in mind, how dare we turn our backs on the Bowl, or Abel's Rest, or Nyx, when they need us! How dare we let oligarchs prey on the weak! How dare we choose not to act when we have, by virtue of our votes in the Assembly and our voice within the halls of public debate, the means to share our peace and prosperity with the rest of our people!\
	<br><br>\
	This is what I mean by SolGov being the only true republic, the only state founded for the common good. The 'human spirit' West croons on about isn't our industriousness, or our skill at arms. If humanity-- if this Terran culture is commendable for anything, it is that we assist our fellows. We take in Casteless Skrell, Unbound Unathi, republican Tajaran. We pass around the hat when someone's house burns down. We help our friends, our neighbors, and even strangers. The fact that Martei and Harper are perverting this impulse, padding their juntas with the air of legitimacy to inspire honest people to ride to their defense, is the reason their state is unconscionable, the reason it was was born flawed, the reason we cannot suffer it to continue, much less help it on its way.\
	<br><br>\
	Now, I'm sure you've noticed by now, that I haven't said much more than three words about technoprogressivism, or transtech, or whatever the word du jour is. Frankly, that's on purpose. 'Transtech' has never once been about technology. The Icarus Front-- the old one, that united us and took us to the stars, not the new one we spend forty hours a week arguing with about healthcare-- The Icarus Front was a popular revolution, you know. Hel, they were Marxists. It was a world where the kind of lack of accountability, the entrenched oligarchy and geographical class divide that we're dealing with now was spiraling out of control. In the old United States, the rich and powerful got the technology to grow loyal subjects in tubes, to make drone intelligences smarter in some ways than a human could ever be, to-- well, to do what Angessa Martei's done, only with no SolGov to stop her. Meanwhile, the 'little people' in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and other 'forgotten' parts of the world were left behind, hopelessly. I don't mean to downplay the importance of the Gray Tide, but if you look at historical accounts from that era, the thing that really united the Front was the knowledge that, if they didn't act immediately, they'd be seen as 'externalities' by immortal superintelligent businesspeople and politicians. The take-away from the Gray Tide should never have been that 'nanotechnology is dangerous'-- it should have been 'nobody should be able to destroy an entire city without facing consequences.'\
	<br><br>\
	That was more of a history lesson than I had meant, but it's important to look at these sorts of things in context. I know transtech and the Five Points have been used as an excuse for pejudice against Skrell, Mercurials, positronics, the FTU, communism, the disabled, and most recently Prometheans. But all the Five Points are supposed to mean - what they would say if the people who had written them were alive today, is that everyone deserves an equal playing field. When the ruling class is smarter, stronger, and longer lived than the classes they rule over-- well, I could wax poetic again, or I could just point you towards the Hegemony and their 'clients'. The Hegemony is bad enough. Let's not give Angessa Martei a chance to outdo them."

	data = "The Sol Economic Organization has announced that Calvert Moravec, nephew of NanoTrasen CEO Albary Moravec will be running under their ticket in the upcoming Vir gubernatorial elections. Calvert has stated that he will run on a pro-business platform, and has chosen Vir to do so due to the 'Unique beauty and economic prospects of an interstellar crossroads such as Vir'.\
	<br><br>\
	Despite being a lifelong resident of Alpha Centauri, Moravec was recently approved for Vir citizenship, making him eligible for local candidacy and has reportedly moved into a luxurious New Reykjavik penthouse. Perhaps best known for his soaring stock market investment success over the previous few years, Calvert's first foray into politics is not wholly unexpected as the Moravec family has long leveraged their wealth in international affairs, though successful election would mark their first sitting member of the Colonial Assembly. Fellow SEO candidate Councillor Hal Wekstrom has expressed his full support for Moravec.\
	<br><br>\
	Three candidates will be elected as representatives to the Colonial Assembly later this year, with the most popular also attaining the position of system governor."

	data = "Icarus Front Representative Candidate Vani Jee has delayed the remainder of her campaign tour of orbital colonies and outposts around the Vir system after an alleged altercation with NanoTrasen security.\
	Candidate Jee had been visiting the NLS Southern Cross, a NanoTrasen station in Sif orbit to receive a corporate tour and meet with voters, when her concluding question and answer session was interrupted by hecklers, leading to the event being cut short. Jee alleges that footage of the event was seized by NanoTrasen corporate security and has accused the trans-stellar corporation of the intentional intimidation of Icarus Front and Shadow Coalition candidates in what she describes as 'a clear display of corruption in favour of company-favourite Calvert Moravec', though she has praised the individual employees of the Cross for their hospitality and thought-provoking questions.\
	<br><br>\
	Vani Jee is running on a platform of free access to education, Sivian self-determination, and isolationist foreign policy. She has refused to make any strong statements regarding hot-button issues such as the Five Points.\
	<br><br>\
	She intends to resume her scheduled tour after a three day break."
