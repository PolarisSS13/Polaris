	name = "08/30/61-- VGA Legalizes Prometheans; Nanotrasen Begins Manufacture and Testing"
	data = "Today's meeting of the Vir Bicameral led to the passing of the Wynther-Helsey Bill, an implementation of the legal framework \
	used in Aetolus to handle the production and cultivation of the Macrolimbus species dubbed \"Prometheans\". These ill-researched organisms \
	possess cognitive abilities easily equaling those of A-class drones, but so far have not been included under the EIO's list of dangerous \
	intelligences and are thus much more profitable for manufacture as expert systems by corporations such as NanoTrasen.\
	<br></br>\
	While many systems in the Almach Rim have already passed similar bills, this is the first system so close to Sol to have done so. More\
	concerning still is NanoTrasen's business practice regarding the intelligences: much like their positronic lines, sources within the\
	company indicate that they will be \"farmed out\" to employees of the corporation and residents of their Northern Star and Cynosure\
	habitation complexes. Quote our source, who wishes to remain anonymous, \"\[we\] call the program 'Lend-Lease', sometimes. The whole idea\
	is that we only have to pay the\ cost of the Promethean core, which is about 2000-3000 thalers after startup costs, and we still get\
	the data we need while \[our\] own employees pay to feed 'em and put hours into raising them.\"\
	<br></br>\
	The bill passed fairly quietly this afternoon, owing to the closed nature of the Bicamarial. A post-facto Occulum poll of voting-age\
	VGA citizens suggest that fully 80% of them did not even know what a Promethean was prior to the most recent general election. A\
	follow-up poll indicates that an appreciable number of Sivians do not support the framework's current implementation."

	name = "2/3/62-- Corporate Coup on Aetolus"
	data = "A recent incident aboard the NRS Prometheus issued in a major change in the leadership of the Promethean homeworld. During \
	a late-night meeting of the Nanotrasen Board of Trustees, several high-ranking personnel, including Head of Research Naomi Harper,\
	announced their intention to assume direct control of Nanotrasen facilities in the system. It is known that several dissenting \
	members of the board were shot to death by Promethean test subjects. Our information comes from a survivor of the coup, who for \
	reasons of security has chosen to remain annonymous. All outbound shipments affiliated with Nanotrasen have ceased.\
	<br><br>\
	While neither Grayson Manufacturies nor Nanotrasen have made an official statement, Nanotrasen CEO Albary Moravec has called the \
	incident \"shocking, if the allegations are to be believed\" and has assured shareholders that Nanotrasen will respond to the \
	incident with as much force as it warrents.<br><br>Requests for a statement directed to the Board of Trustees or Dr. Harper were \
	not responded to. Free Traders are recommended to stay clear of the region until the situation resolves itself."

	name = "2/10/62-- Aetolian Partisans Declare Independence"
	data = "Breaking their week-long silence, the leaders of the Aetolian Coup, and their spokesperson and presumed leader Naomi Harper issued an address earlier today, delivered to the Oculum Broadcast office on Pearl by drone courier. Quote Dr. Harper: \"Our previous silence was a necessity, while we consolidated our forces and dealt with corporatists both internally and in Vounna's former Grayson outposts.\". In Harper's hour-long address, she berates the failure of SolGov to provide adequate protections for Prometheans. \"We will not let the Promethean be another positronic brain; they will not labor under a century of slavery, deprived of a state to call their own. The Luddites of the Friends and of the Icarus Front will not be permitted to decide the fate of a nascent race before it begins.\"\
	<br><br>\
	Harper proceeded to unilaterally declare Vounna's independence from SolGov, claiming sovereignty over the system as the first Chairperson of the \"Aetolian Council\". Speaker of the Shadow Coalition ISA-5 has urged their government to treat the developing situation with caution but decried Harper's rhetoric, stating in a press release, \"While I know well the injustices visited on myself and my people by misguided forbearers, it is important to treat any emerging technology with respect. Current policies regarding the Prometheans are designed to limit risk during sociological trials on Aetolus and beyond. As for myself, I doubt the sincerity of this human who claims to speak for the Prometheans, when the Prometheans are perfectly equipped to speak for themselves.\"\
	<br><br>\
	NanoTrasen is expected to redouble their Promethean research programs in the Vir system until stability is restored to Vounna."

	name = "2/14/62-- SCG Denounces Aetolian Coup; Mobilizes Fleet"
	data = "Dismissing claims of inaction, a spokesperson for the Solar Confederate Government today confirmed that the Colonial Assembly has voted overwhelmingly in favor of swift military action in response to the coup on Aetolus earlier this month. Icarus Front Chairperson Mackenzie West was quick to make a damning official statement: \"Dr. Harper and her radical agitators cannot be excused for their violent, despicable attempts to destabilize the flourishing economy of the Almach Rim. The ruthless murder of innocents, and illegal seizure of private property are crimes that cannot merely be met with strong words and gentle slaps to the wrist\"...\"I am proud to announce that two units of brave Solar marines have been assigned to the SCG-R Song Shi rapid response cruiser, with the full backing of the Icarus Front - and I hope with my heart, the backing of all patriotic Solar citizens.\"¬ù\
	<br><br>\
	The decision faced resistance from more laissez faire Assembly member states, including prominent SEO governor Bruno Ofako, delaying an earlier consensus. Supporters of the action hope that this decisive display of military strength will encourage the rebels to stand down without further bloodshed, and submit to prosecution by the Lunar High Courts.\
	<br><br>\
	The Icarus Front has also proposed a temporary ban on continued Promethean research, though this motion has yet to gain any traction."

	name = "2/23/62-- \"Almach Association\" Shocks Nation"
	data = "Shocking the nation, in the wee hours UTC a number of governments in the Almach Rim announced their intent to secede from the Confederacy as a unified political organization they refer to as the Almach Association, joining the already-declared Aetolian Council. Among the half-dozen affected systems is Angessa's Pearl, through which the Song Shi was passing en route to Aetolus. The Association has already issued a political manifesto and a foundational charter, leading political scientists across the galaxy to suspect back-doors collusion and possible Shelfican interference, a hypothesis made more likely by Morpheus Cyberkinetics' exonet site voicing support for the Association. Others suspect a moment of political crystallization, not unlike that in the Golden Hour three centuries ago. These researchers are already referring to this morning's events as the Gray Hour.\
	<br><br>\
	The Association's official manifesto repudiates the Five Points, calling them \"an archaic and distinctly human invention\". Experts agree that this bold declaration puts the Movement more in line with the Golden Hour than with the Age of Secession, and many fear that nothing short of a miracle like the discovery of the positronics will spare humanity from a bloody civil war.\
	<br><br>\
	While the Association currently lists only a handful of Almach Rim systems as \"Constituent Organizations\", it has named Shelf, the Free Relan Federation, and the Eutopian Foreign Relations Board as \"observers\". The implications of this status are yet to be identified.\
	<br><br>\
	The fate of the SCG-R Song Shi and her crew remain unknown."
