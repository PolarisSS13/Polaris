	description = "Most Teshari follow the unique cultural traditions of their specific pack, which vary as widely as any other species' \
	idea of nations. Pack Teshari tend to be highly social, curious, and open people, with little concept of privacy and a high tendency \
	towards sharing and mutual aid. Many packs remain mostly on Sirisai, with those venturing into human space doing so via Skrellian \
	sponsorship programmes, though others exist wholly outside of the homeworld."

	description = "Adopting the Skrellian name for their people, Ka'merr prefer to integrate fully into Skrell society, rejecting some or \
	all Teshari pack traditions and lifestyles, and often see themselves as superior to Teshari who don't share their enthusiasm. Though \
	still treated relatively poorly by the Skrellian caste system, the Ka'merr see integration as the best way for their people to earn the \
	respect of the Skrell and further their place in society."

	description = "Mostly remaining in the barren polar regions of Sirisai, Autonomist Teshari are those who have rejected contact with Skrell \
	society on the basis that they believe Teshari society cannot progress on its own terms if it relies on the 'generosity' of its neighbors. \
	These traditionalist Teshari usually push for the separation of the species, with some going so far as to call for the expulsion of the Skrell \
	from their homeworld. Naturally, Autonomists often lack access to the Skrell's spacefaring technology, and few are both willing and able \
	to venture beyond Sirisai."

	opportunity to establish their own packs amongst the stars. Uniquely truly independent of Skrell society, Teshari Spacers usually struggle \
	with lack of access to specialist technology for their people, and are often the ones to provide it to others. Most are still fiercely mutualist, \
	and share many traits with Pack Teshari."
