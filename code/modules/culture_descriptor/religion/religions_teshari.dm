	name = "Teshari Pack Spiritualism"
	description = "While varying by pack, Teshari religions usually take the form of animism; the belief that every thing - living or otherwise - has a spirit, and should be treated appropriately. The specific needs, desires and powers of these spirits varies greatly, but keeping them satisfied is the primary intent of most Teshari religious rituals. Many of these religions believe that both good and bad things happen as a result of the whims of these spirits, particularly 'world spirits' representing large areas, objects, or phenomena. Methods of appeasement can include sacrifices, prayer, altered mind states, crafts and performance, including festivals. Some packs believe that modern practices such as artificial lifeforms, the use of prosthetics, and especially cloning, can upset or confuse the spirits and either refuse to make use of them, or insist on rituals to comfort affected spirits."
