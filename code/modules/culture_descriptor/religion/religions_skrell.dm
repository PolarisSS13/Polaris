	name = "Xilar Qall"
	description = "Xilar Qall is one of the Skrell's oldest religions. Its most well-known story describes the Skrell learning to speak from a mysterious singing voice in the sky, though few still place any stock in that idea. Being such an old religion that spans the entirety of Skrellian space, it has very few established practices, but many living there continue to value the ethical teachings of collectivism and technological enlightenment. In Human space, Xilar Qall is practiced almost exclusively by Skrellian immigrants, who struggle to find converts among the much more egalitarian human populations."
