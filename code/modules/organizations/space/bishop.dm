	bioconservatives), Bishop manufactures not only prostheses but also brain augmentation, synthetic organ replacements, \
	and odds and ends like implanted wrist-watches. Their business model tends towards smaller, boutique operations, giving \
	it a reputation for high price and luxury, with Bishop cyberware often rivalling Vey-Med's for cost. Bishop's reputation \
	for catering towards the interests of human augmentation enthusiasts instead of positronics have earned it ire from the \
	Positronic Rights Group and puts it in ideological (but not economic) comptetition with Morpheus Cyberkinetics."
