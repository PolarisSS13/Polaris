		You are holding an <b>arcane tome</b>, a book that contains the rites and scriptures of the Geometer. In addition to this informational section (the <b>Archives</b>), you can browse <b>Runes</b> within a dedicated section of the tome, allowing you to see their functions and
		<br /><br />
		The tome is an essential tool, and every cultist should have one unless they have a good reason not to. It's small enough to fit into pockets, webbing, and so on, so it should be easy to find a place to squeeze it. That being said, arcane tomes are strange things to nonbelievers, and security may become concerned if they see one, especially near runes; try and keep it concealed.
		<br /><br />
		If need be, your tome can serve as a weapon as well. Simply switch to Harm intent and attack your foes with it to deal burn damage. Naturally, doing so will be abundantly obvious to your target and everyone around.
	{{else data.archive == 2}}
		<b>Runes</b> are eldritch scrawlings, etched with precise shapes and words to invoke the power of Nar-Sie. They are the primary source of your power as a cultist, and they allow you to perform anomalous feats akin to magic. Some runes can be made into <b>talismans</b> that offer something akin to their abilities in a more portable form.
		<br /><br />
		There are many different types of rune, each with their own function and method of use. Runes are drawn in blood (or a close equivalent), meaning that you'll take a small amount of damage each time you create one. To invoke a rune, simply click on it with an empty hand.
		<br /><br />
		Runes are naturally very conspicuous, and you should be careful to keep them well-hidden to avoid drawing unnecessary suspicion. You can erase a rune by clicking on it with your tome - leaving no trace of its existence - or just clean it up like any regular spill.
		<br /><br />
		Notably, AIs cannot perceive runes. Instead, they just see them as a regular pool of blood. That's still conspicuous in its own right, mind you, so it's no excuse to cut corners on concealment!
	{{else data.archive == 3}}
		Runes are essential for success, but they can be difficult to lay down quickly and conveniently. <b>Talismans</b> alleviate this problem, serving essentially as portable runes. They're created by invoking the <i>Imbue Talisman</i> rune with a blank sheet of paper on top and a valid rune type nearby, at which point that rune will be etched onto the paper, turning it into a talisman that can be carried and activated at any time.
		<br /><br />
		The effects of talismans are usually equivalent to that of their respective rune, but weaker. Some, however, can be vastly different; the Stun talisman, for instance, causes a heavy stun to a single target struck with the talisman, instead of disorienting everyone nearby. Cultists starting aboard the station are equipped with a special Supply talisman that allows them to make certain talismans for free or to create soul shards and construct shells.
		<br /><br />
		Like runes, talismans are inherently conspicuous. In addition to appearing visibly different - with bloody markings on the surface - any attempts to write on the paper or alter its contents will invariably fail. Keep them hidden too!
	{{else data.archive == 4}}
		Depends! Stealth and infiltration are your best ally, so unless you've already been ousted, it's never a bad idea to simply go back to what you were doing as if nothing had happened. You can keep in touch with other cultists across distances and z-levels by using a <i>Communicate</i> rune, and coordinating in this manner is very important.
		<br /><br />
		When you feel inclined to introduce more people to the fold, you should go about it carefully. Conversion through the <i>Convert</i> rune is <b>opt-in</b> - the convertee can simply keep refusing to join the cult and will take increasing damage instead - so above all else, remember to <b>roleplay</b> and make it an interesting experience. Avoid just stunning someone and dragging them to the rune - lead up to it. Talk to them, manipulate them, be evil and weird. Make their conversion <i>mean</i> something, and it'll be more fun for everyone.
