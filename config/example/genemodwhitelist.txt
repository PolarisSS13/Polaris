# The ckeys of players whitelisted to use general-use sprite accessories.
# Note that this is in the format of "canonical" ckeys, which according to the byond docs are basically just lower-case:
#
# Format:
#    ckey(Key) 
# Args:
#    Key
#        The player key to convert to canonical form.
# Returns:
#    The key in canonical form. To do this, it strips all punctuation and space from the key and converts to lowercase. The result is still unique for each different key. 
#
# You can actually fill this file with whatever besides the whitelisted ckeys because the matching is very dumb

text that has spaces and so isn't really a ckey (It does nothing)
