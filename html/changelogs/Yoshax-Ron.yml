changes: 
  - rscadd: "Guns purchases from the antag uplink will now come with the ability to be DNA Locked. There are several verbs pertaining to this, Give DNA, Remove DNA and Allow Samples. Give DNA gives the gun your DNA, Remove DNA removes all the DNA samples. The first person to give their DNA to the gun is the Primary Controller and can use the Allow Samples verb, which toggles whether or not the gun will accpet further DNA. A DNA locked gun when it has DNA cannot be fired by anyone who does not have their DNA stored in the gun."
  - tweak: "For backend stuff, the antag uplink code has been expanded to allow for extra arguments to be given to the new() of the item being spawned."
