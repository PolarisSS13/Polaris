# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.

changes: 
  - tweak: "When the supermatter explodes, it now leaves behind a shattered plinth that continues to emit radiation. You should probably get rid of it."
  - bugfix: "If you destroy the supermatter early (e.g. through admin deletion shenanigans), it no longer irradiates everyone forever."
  - bugfix: "Welding lockers now actually updates their sprite properly."
  - tweak: "Every floor tile now has a minor (2%) chance to spawn with some dirt on it. The Janitor now has a job again."
  - tweak: "Similarly, every Sif grass tile now has a minor (5%) chance to spawn with some fancy eyebulb grass on it. It can be removed by clicking on it with harm intent."
  - rscadd: "Adds cats-in-boxes, which can be activated (once) to spawn cats. There's an orange tabby (Cargo cats) and a tuxedo (Runtime) version."
  - bugfix: "Fixes a material duplication exploit."
