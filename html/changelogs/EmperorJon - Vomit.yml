changes: 
  - bugfix: "Having between 20 and 100 nutrition and over 45 toxin damage will no longer cause you to gag ad-infinitum and die. It now respects vomit time restraints."
  - tweak: "Gagging now occurs only when the mob has no nutrition at all. It no longer causes three toxin damage, only weakens as before."
  - tweak: "Vomiting and/or gagging from toxins now occurs regardless of nutrition, not only 20+."
