changes:

  - tweak: "Suit sensor consoles now display a friendly textual indicator of what z-level someone is on, instead of a number. They will also now avoid spoiling the names of Points of Interest."
  - tweak: "The beakers containing Cryoxadone near cryogenics are now labeled. (Requested by Nalarac.)"
  - bugfix: "The sleeper consoles now finally face towards the sleepers, at last. It only took a year for someone to fix it."
