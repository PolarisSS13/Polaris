changes: 
  - rscadd: "Xenoarcheology code has been partially redone."
  - tweak: "Pick set will now sort the picks inside it."
  - tweak: "Removed useless random numbers from GPS coordinates in various places. I'm sure we have not lost the arcane knowledge of rounding 500 years into the future."
  - tweak: "Picks renamed to show their excavation depths."
  - tweak: "Suspension generator's power use lowered."
  - tweak: "Suspension generator's different field types removed. By the way, remember that they can suspend any item and even mobs."
  - tweak: "Archeology belts and pick sets can now hold small pickaxes. Pick sets still only have 7 slots. Brushes fit on your ears."
  - tweak: "Empty rock drop rate reduced."
  - tweak: "Empty rock renamed from "rock" to "small rock" so you can tell if you are clicking on a turf or an item when hovering over it."
  - tweak: "Empty boulder spawn rate reduced."
  - tweak: "Tape measuring is a bit faster."
  - tweak: "Scanner now shows the lowest and the highest depth of the find (highest is depth + clearance) for easier calculations. Ideally, you need to hit exactly the lowest spot. Less ideally, hit anywhere between higest and lowest. Hit below lowest and you have a chance to break the find."
  - tweak: "You can now use a brush to clear strange rocks. Welder uses less fuel for that than before."
  - tweak: "Anomaly analyser's report made a bit easier to read."
  - tweak: "Anomaly locater will now also locate normal finds."
  - bugfix: "Gas masks will now correctly spawn as archeological finds."
  - bugfix: "Digsites will now properly contain several (4-12) turfs in a 5x5 radius. Be careful when digging near your finds."
  - bugfix: "Suspension generator will now correctly turn off (qdel issue)."
  - bugfix: "Archeology overlays won't disappear when the icon is updated (e.g. when mining next to it)."
  - bugfix: "Archeology overlays won't overlap each other and will properly disappear when you mine out a find."
  - bugfix: "Some spawning oddities were fixed."
  - bugfix: "Checks for whether you get a strange rock or a clean item were fixed (previously it always gave you clean item where it should have been rolling a random number)."
  - bugfix: "Can no longer get rid of any item by putting it into evidence bag and bag into core sampler."
  - bugfix: "Can no longer irreversibly fold pick set into cardboard."
  - bugfix: "CO2 generator effect now has a type."
  - bugfix: "Phoron generator effect will now always generate phoron, not sometimes phoron and sometimes oxygen."
