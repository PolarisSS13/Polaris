  - tweak: "Changes how the grid check event works.  A new machine called the grid checker exists in engineering, near the engineering substation.  The actual event now involves a power spike originating from the engine, which the grid checker will activate upon sensing it, and causing a blackout.  Engineering can restore power faster if they hack the grid checker correctly.  A piece of paper left in the substation has more details."
