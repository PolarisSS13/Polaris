Taken mostly from https://tgstation13.org/wiki/Guide_to_Changelogs#Updating_the_Changelog with a few changes.

First, install Python 2.7. Yes, it's outdated, but that's what the script is made to work with.
Make sure that Python 2.7 and its Scripts/ folder is in PATH
Upgrade pip, as outlined here https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/
Once pip is installed, you will need to run two commands from your terminal or command prompt to install packages
1. 'pip install PyYaml'
2. 'pip install beautifulsoup4'

Once all this is done, you should just be able to run ss13_genchangelog.py and sit back.

If you get errors running it, two things are possible.
1. You installed something wrong.
2. Someone formatted their changelog wrong.
Check where the error was, do a bit of troubleshooting, see if it wasn't #2. Fixing the syntax in the yaml files is pretty simple.
